# Fluxo.io

A modern monorepo built with Turborepo, featuring automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions and code quality tools.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start development:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Build all packages:**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Git Hooks (Husky)

This project uses Husky to manage Git hooks for code quality:

### Pre-commit Hook

- Runs `lint-staged` to check only staged files
- Automatically fixes ESLint issues and formats code with Prettier
- **Location:** `.husky/pre-commit`

### Commit Message Hook

- Validates commit message format using Conventional Commits
- Ensures consistent commit history
- **Location:** `.husky/commit-msg`

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm prepare` - Initialize Husky git hooks
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint across the codebase
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

## ðŸ¤– CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a minimal GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on every push and pull request:

- **Build**: Compiles all packages and apps
- **Lint**: Runs ESLint across the codebase
- **Type Check**: Validates TypeScript types

### Adding More Jobs

To add more CI jobs, uncomment and modify the example in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Example: How to add more jobs
test:
  name: ðŸ§ª Test
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build

  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: "18"

    - name: Setup pnpm
      uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      with:
        version: 8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

    - name: Run tests
      run: pnpm test
```

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```
